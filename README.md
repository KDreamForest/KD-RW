### DR-WR Readme
#### What's this project?
This project is a simple project with a amazing kernel module driver.The driver can hide itself by using the function "MiProcessLoaderEntry",**It's a no-doc function.So if you want to use it in your own computer or other version's windows.You must get the base of the function yourself.** But luckily it's not so difficult.And I'm preparing to make a certain tool to get the bases of the no-doc functions.
#### How can I use it?
I build this project with Visual Studio 2022.
Here is the list of SDK:
- Visual Studio 2022 or Higher
- Windows Driver Kit 10.0.22621.0 or Higher
- Windows SDK 10.0.22621.0 or Higher
In fact you can compile the code in lower versions of SDKs if you want.The project didn't use any new functions added in new SDK.
#### Oh,I found some bugs!
It's normal that you can find some bugs in this project.
In fact I'm not good at kernel programing.So if you found some bugs,you can pull a request with fixed codes or email me at dreamforestmaple@gmail.com
